Data Science Tools
Tool	Description
Python	A versatile programming language with rich data science libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.
R	A statistical computing and graphics language with a wide range of data analysis and visualization packages.
SQL	A language for managing and querying relational databases, crucial for data extraction and analysis.
Jupyter Notebook	An interactive environment for creating and sharing documents that contain live code, equations, and visualizations.
TensorFlow	An open-source machine learning framework developed by Google for building and deploying machine learning models.
PyTorch	An open-source deep learning framework with support for dynamic computation graphs and neural network development.
Tableau	A powerful data visualization tool that enables the creation of interactive and shareable data dashboards.
Apache Spark	An open-source big data processing framework known for its speed and ease of use in processing large datasets.
Scikit-learn	A machine learning library for Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
Excel	A widely used spreadsheet program for data analysis, reporting, and basic statistical operations.
These are just a few of the many tools used in the field of data science, each serving various purposes in data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.
